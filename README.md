This user-friendly and simple app helps answer the age-old question: “What should I eat?”

Multiple options can oftentimes be overwhelming and complicate the process of deciding on one place to eat.  Our app cuts down that process by providing users with one food option based on their mood.  

The user will type in their current mood and will be provided with a food option closest to their zip code.

The front-end team consisted of Anna and Justin, and the technology utilized includes: HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Animate.css.  The back-end team consisted of Chelsey and Simeon, and the technology utilized includes:  JavaScript, jQuery, Google Places & Maps API, Indico API, and Firebase.
